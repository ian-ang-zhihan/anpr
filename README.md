# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System

An exploratory team project that prototyped an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system using **OpenCV** and **YOLO**. The goal was to reduce congestion at pickup/drop-off zones by recognizing registered license plates from a distance and automating gate access ‚Äî eliminating the need for manual check-ins by security guards.

## Background
This was one of my first ‚Äúbig‚Äù projects and my introduction to **computer vision** and **AI**. I worked on it with two teammates during my A-Levels in 2020, when all of us were new to Computer Science and Software Engineering.  

Looking back, it‚Äôs amusing that we didn‚Äôt even use version control ‚Äî Git and GitHub were completely unknown to us at the time. For the sake of documenting my journey and growth, I decided to upload the project files here as proof of the work we did.  

Despite the challenges, this project was a meaningful milestone: it sparked my interest in AI, taught me how to explore technical problems beyond the classroom, and showed me the importance of tools and practices (like version control) that I now rely on daily. 

## Features
- License plate detection using **OpenCV** and **YOLO**  
- Character recognition for older, non-reflective license plates  
- Conceptual design for an automated gate access system linked to recognized plates

## Roadblocks & Learnings
Like many early projects, this one faced technical limitations that we couldn‚Äôt overcome at the time:  
- **No version control**: We didn‚Äôt use Git or GitHub, which made collaboration and iteration harder  
- **Hardware limitations**: Our only cameras were laptop webcams or basic USB webcams borrowed from teachers. They struggled with glare from modern reflective license plates, so recognition only worked reliably on older vehicles  
- **System scope**: We never reached the gate access integration because plate recognition itself wasn‚Äôt reliable enough with our setup  

Even though the project didn‚Äôt fully succeed, it was a valuable introduction to working in a team, tackling real-world problems, and understanding both the potential and limitations of AI/vision systems.  

## Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV** for image processing  
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for object detection
